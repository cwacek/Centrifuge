BitBook
=======

What
----
A system that uses the technology behind bit coins to encrypt eBooks and allow them to be shared in a manner that prevents replications.

Why?
----
My one frustration with eBooks is my inability to share them with my friends and family. The reasons behind this are many, but essentially, content companies don't want their books to simply multiply and become freely available on the internet. Thus they include DRM to prevent you from sharing them. My concept is to use the concept behind bitcoins to govern eBook DRM, such that if I give someone a book, I do not have it any more.
